### Hi  👋

😉🎓Qingchen graduated from Northwest University and explored machine learning for brain age prediction during his master years. 

🤔After which, he began his engineering career in the industry in 2021 but was still interested in the combination of machine learning and psychiatric research. 

😄Thus he joined Dr. Cui's lab as a research assistant to continue exploring the correlation between psychiatry and the ageing brain.✨
